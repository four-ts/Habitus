# Habitus
A DECO3500 Project focusing on social mobile computing in relation to habit change. 

## Project Description 
This application aims to export the domain of effective habit formation through the motivating and incentivising users through the power of a community.
Each user should ideally be paired with a friend (also known as habit buddy) to accomplish a shared goal. 
They keep each other accountable and supportive throughout this experience.

The application currently mimics the pathway of a new user and supports according features. 
This includes enforcing a user to first register an account onto the app and creating an initial goal with milestones and then creating tasks for the milestone. 
The user can then navigate to the homepage where they can see their newly made goal's milestone and associated tasks to achieve and a "feed" of posts from other users who are achieving their goal. 
The user can also upload a photo from their camera with a caption to also add to the feed. 
This is to support and encourage users to share their goal accomplishments and to recieve support from others.
The final feature of the app is a mimic of a text chat capability with the users buddy. The user is able to message their buddy to talk, encourage and support each other in acheiving their shared goal.

The application is our very first initial scope of our project and has limited functionality to achieve our goals in creating effective habit formation. For more information please checkout our high-fidelity [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/AOUvquQmIBG10mJCMCqYlb/Design?node-id=27%3A3)
